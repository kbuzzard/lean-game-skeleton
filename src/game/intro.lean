# The Maze Game, version 1.0.0.

## By Kevin Buzzard 

An idea coming out of discussions with Kendall Frey.

# What is this game?

You are in a maze of twisty passages, all distinct (at this point).
Use the tactics `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` to escape.
Use the `out` tactic to get out when you're at the exit room.
